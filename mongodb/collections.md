# Collections Overview

Collections in MongoDB are the basic way to store documents.  Where as a table in a traditional relational database will store a single row, a document in a collection can store many values much like an object.

## Capped Collections

Capped collections provide an overall size limit on the collection.  Once the collection grows to this size, older documents are removed.

## Indexes

Indexes are available to aid in query performance improvements.  Many of the same options are available.
