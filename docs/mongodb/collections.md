# Collections Overview

Collections in MongoDB are the basic way to store documents.  Where as a table in a traditional relational database will store a single row, a collection stores many documents. A document in turn can store many properties in a hierarchical structure.

# Capped Collections

Capped collections provide an overall size limit on the collection.  Once the collection grows to this size, older documents are removed.

# Indexes

Indexes are available to aid in query performance improvements.  They are similar to indexes in other database systems, but offer a few unique options as well.
