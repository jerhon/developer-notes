# Queries

MongoDB queries support many of the same things that are supported in basic SQL queries.  However, the syntax is less appealing than SQL due to it's JSON nature.

## Simple Queries

Simple queries are done through the .find() method on the collection in the shell.  If you are using a mongo driver, a similar command is used on the driver.  For example, the javascript driver has a method "find" which maps very directly to the shell method.

Given the following mongodb created from the shell
```



```

## Query All Rows

mongo.find()
