# Transaction Codes

SAP's main form of work is carried out in transactions.  Which are various UI screens which perform business operations.  To get to one of the UI screens, it's necessary to know the transaction code.


## Integration Transaction Codes

These are various transaction codes that are helpful to me when working with IDocs.

* WE20 - Partner profiles
* WE02 - Lookup IDocs


## Business Transaction Codes

These are various business related transaction codes.

* VAxx = Sales orders
* VFxx = Invoices

* 03 = View

Thus VA03 = view sales, VA03 = view Invoices
