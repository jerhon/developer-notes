# Computer Science

This topic contains some information related to basic computer science ideas.  This includes things like algorithms, code snippets to solve theoretical problems, etc.

I've been working through [CodeSignal](https://www.codesignal.com) problems as a refresher on some basic computer science algorithms and concepts that typically aren't used in the business world on a day to day basis.  This gives me an opportunity to document them as a learning experience.
