# Auth0 Overview

Auth0 is a cloud hosted OAuth service for securing applications with integrations into multiple other ID providers such as Facebook, Google, or Database Based Credentials, etc.   

## Pros
* Well defined integration and a number of good walk-throughs
* Rolling your own security is easy to get wrong
* Pay as you go (free tier would work for testing / simple development)
* Customizable login pages, etc.
* RS256 provides a way to verify tickets without requiring a direct connection to auth0 all the time.

## Cons
* Extra integration to an external service
