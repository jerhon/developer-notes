# Overview

This GIT repository contains notes I use when working on or have worked on development projects.  It can also contain lists of links of source material I have referenced.

I had started a blog many years ago on WordPress.  However, I found that the blog material became outdated over time.  While it's interesting to go back and see what Visual Studio 2012 was like when it was released, that eventually becomes outdated, and just pollutes the web universe.  By hosting this in a GIT controlled wiki, I can keep things up to date, and still go back into the past to dig out old information.

Additionally, with this site, I'm trying to document information I've learned in order to keep it fresh and as a method to better learn and communicate it.

The documentation is stored in github, and it can be distributed via a website.  The website is built through the tool [docsify](https://docsify.js.org).  The only piece that needs to be regenerated from time to time is the "_sidebar.md".  This is automatically generated via a script in the src folder.
