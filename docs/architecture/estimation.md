# Estimation

Break down a project into smaller chunks and estimate a project based on the tasks that will be completed.  There are various methods to making a estimate.

* Ask an Expert - Ask a single person knowledgeable in the work required what they think it will take.  This will produce a number, but accuracy will vary widely.
* Use an Analogy - Based on similar project X that we had previously done, determine how long will it take.
* Draw the Group Together in Consensus - Ask a group of people how long they think it will take, determine an estimate based on that and a confidence level.

In general keep in mind:
* New developers tend to under-estimate.
* Experienced developers tend to over-estimate.

Consider ramp up time for new members to the project, and for new tool sets.
