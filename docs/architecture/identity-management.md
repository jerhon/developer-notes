## Identity Management

* Independent - Everything implemented in the application
* Partial
  * Authentication managed by identity system
  * Authorization is managed by the application
* Complete integration
  * Both are handled in the identity system
  * Can be difficult to deal with, object models may not match or support extension for specific permissions, APIs may not provide all the required data.

Independent or Partial are the most common.

Federated identity - identity management is handled by external entity.
