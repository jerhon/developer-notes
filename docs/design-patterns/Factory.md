# Factory

The factory design pattern focuses on creating objects.  There are a few different flavors of this pattern used for different purposes.

## Simple Factory (AKA Factory Method)

This is a really deceiving name for this pattern.

## Abstract Factory

An abstract factory deals with making "factories of factories".  It comes in play when the abstraction of a factory itself is needed.  It is a Polymorphic factory.
