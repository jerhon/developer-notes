# Design Patterns

When developing software, common problems arise which need to be solved.

Using design patterns often help the coding in several ways.

First, others can recognize what code does by the pattern.  Creating classes and naming them to match the pattern can help other coders recognize the purpose of the class.  For example a CarFactory can help other coders recognize the class utilizes a Factory pattern which creates cars. 

Common problems become easier to resolve.  If a problem matches a pattern, the pattern simply needs to be applied.  Over time, this becomes easier and easier.  

When properly applied, coding patterns can encourage SOLID coding principles.  I'll show examples of these while designing the code.

However, design patterns can be misapplied as well.  Misapplied coding patterns can lead to more verbose code, or code that is difficult to maintain.
