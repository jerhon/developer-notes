# React Overview

React.js is a framework for building modern web applications.



# React Router

This is a npm package which allows navigation in a single page application.  It mainly can be used to build single page applications that have complex routing rules in the browser.

The library uses React Components as it's primary way to build routes, and a very simple interface to get applications up and running.

If you are building a SPA with React, this is a library that typically should be used to obtain routing.
